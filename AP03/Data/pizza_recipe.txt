"To make a simple pizza, first mix flour, a teaspoon of dry yeast and a spoonful of oil into a soft dough, knead it for a few minutes, then let it rest until it puffs up. When it has risen, heat the oven to about 220°C, stretch the dough into a thin round on a floured tray, and spread a layer of tomato sauce on top. Scatter shredded mozzarella over the sauce, then add pieces of ham and sliced olives. Finish with a drizzle of oil and a good sprinkle of oregano, then bake until the crust is golden and the cheese is melted and lightly browned, and serve hot."
